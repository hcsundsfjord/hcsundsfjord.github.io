      This a personal web site.
      To sum up my professional effort within the information technology space; 
      I did my master thesis in computer sciences in 1994. Ever since, I have been involved with some kind of database related project. 
      Most of my work is within the data warehouse and business intelligence area. And most of the time as a techie. 
      I have a strong focus the business needs that drives the solution. 
      I often take the roles as data modeller or data architect as well as doing database implementation work. 
      My vertical experience is mainly from IT engagements at telecom operators, banks, insurance industries and goverment.
