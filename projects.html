2002 RDBMS evaluation. An in-house team with broad database knowledge set off to analyse, test, and evaluate relational database server platforms. The platformswas evaluated for hosting a medium size data mart. Oracle, Sybase, IBM DB2, Teradata and MS SQL Server were included in the study. A simple star schema wasdeployed and populated on each of the platforms, and evaluated with respect retrievals, updates, index building, bulk loading, table partitioning and more.I was responsible for the Oracle part. The project produced an evaluation report with results and recommendations to be used in data mart or warehousedeliveries.
